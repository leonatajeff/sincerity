# Craft Cover Letters with Sincerity: Work in Progress

I've been ghosted by 83% of the applications I've sent, tracked with Google Sheets and Simplify. 540 applications, at least 40 cover letters and 50 short answers of answering why I'd like to work at X company. 

For applications with required cover letters, I've been ghosted by 92% of them. Might be my writing though LOL.

Anyways, I'm building a tool for myself that might be useful for you. Save hours on your job search so you can go outside.
